1. Locate and open the frontend file (HomePage.tsx)
Look at the left-hand sidebar (the file explorer). You should see two top-level folders named backend and frontend.

Click the little arrow (▶) or double-click on frontend to expand it. You’ll see folders like:

java
Copy
Edit
frontend
├── node_modules
├── public
├── src
├── package.json
└── ...
Expand the src folder by clicking on it (click the arrow or double-click it). Inside, you’ll see:

css
Copy
Edit
src
├── components
├── pages
├── styles
└── ...
Expand the pages folder. Now you should see a file called HomePage.tsx (or something similar if your page is named differently).

Click on HomePage.tsx. That will open it in the main editor area (center panel).

What you’ll see in HomePage.tsx:
Somewhere in this file is an <img> (or <svg>) tag whose src attribute uses a data:image/svg+xml;utf8,… string containing unescaped double quotes. That’s what broke your JSX. We need to change that line so the inner quotes are properly escaped or wrapped with backticks.

1.1. Edit HomePage.tsx
Scroll until you find the line that looks like one of these examples (notice the fill="white" inside a src="…"):

tsx
Copy
Edit
<img
  className="logo"
  src="data:image/svg+xml;utf8,<svg viewBox='0 0 100 100' fill="white" xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'>…</svg>"
  alt="Logo"
/>
Replace that entire src="…" line with a backtick‐wrapped template literal so that the inner quotes won’t break JSX. For example:

diff
Copy
Edit
- <img
-   className="logo"
-   src="data:image/svg+xml;utf8,<svg viewBox='0 0 100 100' fill="white" xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'>…</svg>"
-   alt="Logo"
- />
+ <img
+   className="logo"
+   src={`data:image/svg+xml;utf8,<svg viewBox='0 0 100 100' fill='white' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'>…</svg>`}
+   alt="Logo"
+ />
Key points:

The outer opening becomes src={`...`} (backticks inside the {}).

Inside those backticks, any attributes (viewBox='0 0 100 100' or fill='white') must use single quotes so they don’t conflict with the backticks.

The goal is to eliminate any unescaped " inside a src="something".

Save the file (⌘S on Mac, Ctrl+S on Windows). After you save, you should see a little “●” next to the filename in the tab, and the file should now appear under the “Git” pane as modified.

2. Locate and open the backend file (main.py)
In the same file explorer, click the arrow next to backend to expand it. You’ll see something like:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
backend
├── app
│   ├── __pycache__
│   ├── api
│   ├── core
│   ├── db
│   │   ├── __pycache__
│   │   ├── init_db.py
│   │   └── session.py
│   ├── schemas
│   ├── services
│   └── main.py         ← this is the file we need
├── .env.example
├── database_schema.sql
├── README.md
└── requirements.txt
Click on main.py (inside backend/app). That will open the FastAPI application’s main file in the editor.

2.1. Edit main.py to fix the route signature
At the very top of main.py, you might see imports like:

python
Copy
Edit
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, Form, HTTPException, Request
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from .dependencies import get_db
from .schemas import JobApplicationModel
If you see Form in your import line but you never used it, remove Form from that import. So change this:

diff
Copy
Edit
- from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, Form, HTTPException, Request
+ from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException, Request
Scroll down until you find the route definition for /analyze-job-application. It probably looks something like this (but incorrectly uses Depends for both db and request):

python
Copy
Edit
@app.post("/analyze-job-application")
async def analyze_job_application(
    job_data: JobApplicationModel,
    db: Depends(get_db),
    request: Depends(Request)
):
    # …
Replace that incorrect signature with a correct one. Specifically, you want:

db to be typed as Session = Depends(get_db)

request to be typed simply as Request (no Depends())

Make sure you import Request from fastapi.

For example, change to:

diff
Copy
Edit
- @app.post("/analyze-job-application")
- async def analyze_job_application(
-     job_data: JobApplicationModel,
-     db: Depends(get_db),
-     request: Depends(Request)
- ):
+ @app.post("/analyze-job-application")
+ async def analyze_job_application(
+     job_data: JobApplicationModel,
+     db: Session = Depends(get_db),
+     request: Request
+ ):
    """
    Receives a job application payload, analyzes it, and returns a score/feedback.
    """
    if not job_data.resume_text:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Resume text is required.")

    result = analyze_resume(job_data.resume_text, db)
    return {"score": result.score, "feedback": result.feedback}
Save main.py (⌘S or Ctrl+S). Now that file should also appear as “modified” in the Git pane.

3. Commit & Push Changes
Once you’ve saved both files (HomePage.tsx and main.py), we need to commit them to Git and push to GitHub so everything stays in sync.

Open the Git pane on the right side of Replit (click the Git icon if it’s not already visible).

You should now see two files in “Changes to commit”:

bash
Copy
Edit
M  frontend/src/pages/HomePage.tsx
M  backend/app/main.py
In the “Commit message” box at the top of that pane, type a concise, descriptive message. For example:

javascript
Copy
Edit
fix: escape SVG quotes in HomePage.tsx & correct FastAPI route signature
Click Commit & Push.

Replit will create a new commit locally with both modifications and immediately push it to GitHub.

Once the push completes, you’ll see “Nothing to pull or push” again—meaning your Replit workspace and GitHub repo are now fully synchronized.

4. Re-Run Your Frontend and Backend to Verify
After committing and pushing, let’s confirm that both the React front end and the FastAPI back end start up without errors.

4.1 Frontend (React/TypeScript)
In your Replit workspace, locate the Shell/Terminal tab on the left side. If you don’t have a dedicated “frontend” shell open yet, open a new shell and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd frontend
Install dependencies (if necessary):

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
Start the dev server:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run dev
If your project uses npm start instead, run npm start.

Watch the console logs. Because we fixed the unescaped quotes in HomePage.tsx, you should no longer see a “JSX syntax error.”

In Replit’s Preview pane (the small “browser” window), go to the URL of your running frontend (often something like https://<your‐repl‐name>.repl.co). You should see your landing page load normally, and the SVG “logo” (or whatever element was breaking) should now render correctly.

4.2 Backend (FastAPI)
Open a second shell or tab in Replit and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd backend/app
Make sure your Python environment has all dependencies installed:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r ../requirements.txt
Start Uvicorn:

bash
Copy
Edit
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
In the logs, look for something like:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO:     Started server process [pid=…]
INFO:     Application startup complete.
Because we fixed the route signature (db: Session = Depends(get_db) and request: Request), there should be no dependency‐injection errors.

In Replit’s Preview pane, click the “Open in new tab” or copy the forwarded port URL. Navigate to http://localhost:8000/docs.

In the automatic Swagger UI, find POST /analyze-job-application, click Try it out, and send a minimal JSON payload, for example:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "resume_text": "Sample resume text to analyze"
}
You should get back a 200 response with something like:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "score": 85,
  "feedback": "Your resume is well‐structured, but consider adding more details to highlights."
}
If you still see a 422 or a 500 error referencing Depends, re-open main.py to ensure you exactly match the pattern db: Session = Depends(get_db) and request: Request. Save, commit, and restart Uvicorn.

5. Final Check: Git Says “Nothing to Pull or Push”
Now that both front end and back end run without errors, return to the Git pane.

It should read “Nothing to pull or push.”

If you want to double-check on GitHub, open your repository page (github.com/<your-username>/career-compass-ai-beta) in a browser.

The latest commit at the top should be exactly the message you just used (e.g. fix: escape SVG quotes in HomePage.tsx & correct FastAPI route signature).

Click into frontend/src/pages/HomePage.tsx and backend/app/main.py in GitHub to confirm the changes are present.

At this point, everything is synchronized:

Your Replit workspace files have the fixes.

The React frontend compiles and renders without JSX errors.

The FastAPI backend starts cleanly and accepts requests to /analyze-job-application.

Git is up-to-date (“Nothing to pull or push”), and GitHub has your latest commit.

Summary of Where You Are and What You Did
You opened the Replit file explorer, saw frontend and backend.

You opened HomePage.tsx under frontend/src/pages and fixed the unescaped " in the SVG data URI by wrapping it in backticks.

You opened main.py under backend/app and removed the unused Form import, then corrected the FastAPI function signature to use db: Session = Depends(get_db) and request: Request.

You saved both files, saw them show up in Replit’s Git pane, wrote a commit message, and clicked Commit & Push.

You re-ran the frontend (npm run dev) to confirm no more JSX errors.

You re-ran the backend (uvicorn main:app …) to confirm no FastAPI dependency errors.

Git now reports “Nothing to pull or push,” meaning all changes are safely on GitHub.

From here, you can continue building your feature, confident that those two blocking errors are resolved. Let me know if you hit any issues when re-running the servers!
